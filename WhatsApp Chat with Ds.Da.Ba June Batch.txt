Details of the Mandatory Saturday Classes:

Date: Every Saturday
Time: [9:00am] - [5:00pm]
Agenda: In these sessions, we will be covering advanced topics, engaging in practical exercises, and discussing real-world case studies that will significantly enhance your understanding and proficiency in data science.
We understand that Saturdays are typically considered non-working days, and we genuinely appreciate your commitment to your education and career by participating in these sessions.

Placement Responsibility:

Please note that your attendance in these Saturday classes is a crucial factor in our ability to support your placement efforts effectively. Many potential employers value not only academic achievements but also the dedication and extra effort shown by students who are willing to go the extra mile to enhance their skills.

By attending these mandatory Saturday classes, you are demonstrating your commitment to your personal and professional growth, and you are more likely to stand out in the competitive job market.

We must emphasize that consistent non-attendance of these mandatory Saturday classes will be taken into consideration when providing placement support. While we understand that unforeseen circumstances might arise, consistent non-attendance without valid reasons will be noted and could impact the level of support we can provide in securing placements.

We want to ensure that each of you has the best possible chance of achieving your career goals, and this initiative is designed to provide you with the tools and knowledge needed to succeed.

We look forward to seeing all of you at the upcoming Saturday classes, ready to engage, learn, and excel. Your dedication to your education is commendable, and we are confident that your commitment will yield positive outcomes in your future career.

Given a dataset containing information such as the number of years the car has been in use, the distance it has traveled (in kilometers), its rating, condition, the prevailing state of the economy, top speed, horsepower, and torque, the model should effectively analyze these features to estimate the current market value of the car.
